## Description

This project covers the basics of C programming, focusing on variables, conditional statements (`if`, `else`), and loops (`while`). It includes various tasks to help understand these fundamental concepts.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose and usage of variables in C
- Learn how to use `if` and `else` statements for conditional execution
- Understand and implement `while` loops for repeated execution
- Gain hands-on experience with basic C syntax and operations

## Files

- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: A program that assigns a random number to a variable and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.c`: A program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for the letters `q` and `e`.
- `5-print_numbers.c`: A program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`.
- `6-print_numberz.c`: A program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, using only the `putchar` function.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.
- `8-print_base16.c`: A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- `9-print_comb.c`: A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

## Usage

To compile any of the programs, use `gcc` followed by the file name and the `-o` option to specify the output file name. For example:

```sh
gcc 0-positive_or_negative.c -o positive_or_negative
./positive_or_negative
```
