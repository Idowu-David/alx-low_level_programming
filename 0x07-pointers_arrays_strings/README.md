# 0x07. C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This directory contains projects and exercises focused on pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. These concepts are fundamental for understanding memory management and data manipulation in C.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how pointers work and how to use them.
- Learn how to manipulate arrays and strings using pointers.
- Explore multidimensional arrays and their applications.
- Gain proficiency in memory allocation and deallocation.

## Files

- **0-memset.c**: Function that fills memory with a constant byte.
- **1-memcpy.c**: Function that copies memory area.
- **2-strchr.c**: Function that locates a character in a string.
- **3-strspn.c**: Function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
- **4-strpbrk.c**: Function that searches a string for any set of bytes.
- **5-strstr.c**: Function that locates a substring.
- **7-print_chessboard.c**: Function that prints a chessboard.
- **8-print_diagsums.c**: Function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix.
- **100-set_string.c**: Function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

## Usage

Each file contains a specific function implementation. To test the functions, compile them with a `main.c` file using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <file.c> -o <output_name>
```
