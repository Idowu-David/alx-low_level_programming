# 0x08. C - Recursion

This directory contains projects and exercises focused on recursion in the C programming language. Recursion is a fundamental programming concept where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this directory, you should be able to:
- Understand the concept of recursion and how it works.
- Write recursive functions in C.
- Differentiate between recursion and iteration.
- Solve problems using recursive approaches.

| `1-print_rev_recursion.c` | A function that prints a string in reverse using recursion.                 |
| `2-strlen_recursion.c`    | A function that returns the length of a string using recursion.             |
| `3-factorial.c`           | A function that returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.    |
| `4-pow_recursion.c`       | A function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.        |
| `5-sqrt_recursion.c`      | A function that returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.|
| `6-is_prime_number.c`     | A function that checks if a number is a prime number using recursion.       |
| `100-is_palindrome.c`     | A function that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.         |
| `101-wildcmp.c`           | A function that compares two strings with wildcard support.                 |

## Usage

To compile any of the `.c` files, use the `gcc` compiler:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```

Run the compiled program:
```bash
./<output_name>
```
