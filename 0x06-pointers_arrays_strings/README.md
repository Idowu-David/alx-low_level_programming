# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
This project focuses on further exploring pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. It includes various tasks that help in understanding how to manipulate data using pointers and arrays, as well as how to handle strings efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of pointers and how to use them.
- Learn how to manipulate arrays using pointers.
- Gain proficiency in handling strings and performing operations on them.
- Explore different string functions and their implementations.

## Project Tasks
1. **strcat** - Write a function that concatenates two strings.
2. **strncat** - Write a function that concatenates two strings using at most `n` bytes from `src`.
3. **strncpy** - Write a function that copies a string.
4. **strcmp** - Write a function that compares two strings.
5. **reverse_array** - Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
6. **string_toupper** - Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
7. **cap_string** - Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
8. **leet** - Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.
9. **rot13** - Write a function that encodes a string using rot13.
10. **print_number** - Write a function that prints an integer.
11. **infinite_add** - Write a function that adds two numbers.
12. **print_buffer** - Write a function that prints a buffer.

## Usage
To compile and run any of the programs, use the following commands:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename>.c -o <outputname>
./<outputname>
```
