# 0x04. More Functions and Nested Loops

This directory contains projects and exercises focused on more advanced use of functions and nested loops in C programming. The goal is to deepen your understanding of how to create and use functions, as well as how to effectively utilize nested loops to solve complex problems.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and use nested loops
- Learn how to create and use functions
- Understand the scope of variables
- Learn how to use header files

## Projects

1. **0-isupper.c**: A function that checks for uppercase characters.
2. **1-isdigit.c**: A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
3. **2-mul.c**: A function that multiplies two integers.
4. **3-print_numbers.c**: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
5. **4-print_most_numbers.c**: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4.
6. **5-more_numbers.c**: A function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14.
7. **6-print_line.c**: A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
8. **7-print_diagonal.c**: A function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.
9. **8-print_square.c**: A function that prints a square.
10. **9-fizz_buzz.c**: A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 and 5 with "Fizz" and "Buzz".
11. **10-print_triangle.c**: A function that prints a triangle.

## Usage

To compile any of the C files, use the `gcc` compiler:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <outputfile>
```

Run the compiled program:

```sh
./<outputfile>
```
